# ðŸŒ‹ ImageNetPP: A Large-Scale Benchmark of Data Curation Strategies
This is the repository for the ImageNet++ benchmark 

---

We introduce a novel benchmark, ImageNet++, which is the largest and most diverse superset of the ImageNet-1k training set to date. ImageNet++ extends beyond the scope of traditional datasets by incorporating 7 distinct training shifts, each employing a unique modality of data (two natural and one synthetic) and utilizing distinct selection techniques. The constituent datasets of ImageNet++ are enumerated as follows:
1. OpenImages-1000 (OI1000): A subset of the OpenImages dataset constructed via schema mapping.
2. LAION-1000 (LA1000): A subset of the unlabeled LAION dataset, selected through CLIP retrieval nearest neighbors search against the ImageNet-1k training set.
3. Stable Diffusion-1000 (SD1000): A dataset generated from the ImageNet-1k dataset using an image-to-image Stable Diffusion pipeline
